# crazyKind
## Is it possible?

Main idea of this project is to deploy locally kind and, manipulate resources on localstack using crossplane. 

Apparently seems like I am crazy, but I believe that we have a lot of people without acces to some cloud provider.

Step 1: Launch docker;  
Step 2: Launch kind;  
Step 3: Apply localstack via helm;  
Step 4: Apply crossplane via helm.
